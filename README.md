## Description

This project is my own version of the classic 'Battleship' game.

### Rules

If you don't know the game's rules, you can find them [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>). You can also find help in the app by clicking on 'Help'.

The player can place five boards one by one or click on a button to place them randomly.

The player plays first and can attack one of the computer's board square. It will then be the computer's turn and so on.

Once a player has won, the game stop and the winner is declared.

### Computer

The Computer has a beginner level.

It plays randomly until it hits a ship. It will then search around the square to find the ship.

Once the ship is sunk or the computer cannot find it, it restarts the same process.
