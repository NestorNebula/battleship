## About

![App Screenshot](./src/images/battleship.png)

This project is my own version of the classic 'Battleship' game.

If you don't know the game's rules, you can find them [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>). You can also find help in the app by clicking on 'Help'.

The player can place five ships one by one or click on a button to place them randomly.

The player plays first and can attack one of the computer's board square. It will then be the computer's turn and so on.

A player must have sunk (i.e. attacking all the squares where a ship is placed) all of his opponent's ships to be considered as the winner.

Once a player has won, the game stops and the winner is declared.

The Computer has a beginner level.

It plays randomly until it hits a ship. It will then search around the square to find the ship's direction and to sink it.
Once the ship is sunk, it restarts the same process.
